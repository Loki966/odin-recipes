    <p>
      The best things in life are often the simplest — and this fresh cranberry
      sauce, made with just three ingredients, is proof.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 cup of water</li>
      <li>1 cuo of white sugar</li>
      <li>1 (12 ounce) package fresh cranberries (such as Ocean Spray®)</li>
    </ul>  
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Bring water to a boil in a saucepan; add sugar and cook until sugar is
        dissolved, about 5 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Stir cranberries into the saucepan and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to
        low, and simmer until cranberries have popped and sauce is chunky,
        about 10 minutes or longer for desired consistency. The longer you
        cook it, the less chunky it will be.
      </li>
      <li>
        Pour sauce into a serving dish or jars and cover until ready to use;
        the pectin in the cranberries will make the cranberry sauce gel as it
        cools.
      </li>
      <li>Mix cranberry sauce with a fork before serving.</li>
      </ol>
