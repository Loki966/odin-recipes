    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      This classic baked mac and cheese recipe with a buttered bread crumb
      topping is creamy and comforting. It's easy to make the cheese sauce from
      scratch on your stovetop, starting with a roux and adding milk, Cheddar,
      and Parmesan, resulting in a rich, decadent sauce that coats every nook
      and cranny of the noodles. Serve this comfort-food macaroni and cheese
      casserole with grilled meats, sloppy Joes, fried chicken or alongside a
      salad for a meatless dinner.

    <h1>Ingredients</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Macaroni: This homemade mac and cheese starts with a box of uncooked
        macaroni noodles.
      </li>
      <li>
        Butter and flour: You'll need butter and flour to make a roux for the
        cheese sauce. You'll also need two tablespoons of butter for the
        topping.
      </li>
      <li>Milk: Use whole milk for the richest flavor and texture.</li>
      <li>
        Cheese: This baked mac and cheese recipe calls for Cheddar and Parmesan
        cheeses.
      </li>
      <li>
        Seasonings: Salt and pepper goes into the sauce, while paprika is
        sprinkled over the topping.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bread crumbs: Use store-bought dried bread crumbs or make your own at
        home.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease an 8-inch
        square baking dish.
      </li>
      <li>
        Make the macaroni and cheese: Bring a large pot of lightly salted water
        to a boil. Add macaroni and simmer, stirring occasionally, until tender
        yet firm to the bite, about 8 minutes; it will finish cooking in the
        oven. Drain and transfer to the prepared baking dish.
      </li>
      <li>
        While the macaroni is cooking, melt 1/4 cup butter in a medium skillet
        over low heat. Whisk in flour and stir until the mixture becomes
        paste-like and light golden brown, 3 to 5 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Gradually whisk 2 1/2 cups milk into the flour mixture, and bring to a
        simmer. Stir in shredded Cheddar and finely grated Parmesan cheeses;
        season with salt and pepper. Cook and stir over low heat until cheese is
        melted and sauce has thickened, 3 to 5 minutes, adding up to 1/2 cup
        more milk if needed. Pour cheese sauce over macaroni and stir until well
        combined.
      </li>
      <li>
        Make the bread crumb topping: Melt 2 tablespoons butter in a skillet
        over medium heat. Add bread crumbs; cook and stir until well coated and
        browned. Spread bread crumbs over macaroni and cheese, then sprinkle
        with paprika.
      </li>
      <li>Bake in the preheated oven until topping is golden brown and macaroni and cheese is bubbling, about 30 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
